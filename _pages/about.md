I am a first-year PhD computer science student at Arizona State University working under Dr. Hua Wei. I'm committed to the study of reinforcement learning with a focus in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). I'm interested in many aspects of MARL including communication, non-stationarity, exploration-exploitation tradeoff, and am particularly interested in making MARL usable in real-world systems.
