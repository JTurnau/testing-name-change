Education
======
* Ph.D in Computer Science, Arizona State University, 2028 (expected)
* B.S. in COmputer Science, University of Cincinnati, 2024

Work experience
======
* Fall 2024: Research Assistant
  * Conduct a comprehensive literature review and write sections for a survey on techniques which bridge
the gap between simulation and reality
  * Contribute to multi-agent reinforcement learning research focused on bridging the gap between
simulation and reality for traffic signal control
  * Conduct a literature review for multi-agent reinforcement learning techniques and open challenges to
generate novel ideas

* Fall 2024: Teaching Assistant
  * Assist in teaching a graduate-level data mining course with content on classification, model selection /
hyperparameter tuning, data clustering, and dimensionality reduction
  * Hold office hours to support students in understanding course materials and completing assignments
  * Taught lecture on deep neural networks and the transformer architecture

* Fall 2022- Spring 2024: Undergraduate Researcher
  * Conducted research focused on advancing the field of explainable machine learning through the
development of provenance-based explanations
  * Critically analyzed and implemented various machine learning explanation methods, delving into their
mathematical foundations to inform the development of novel explanation methods
  * Applied our novel methods to classic supervised learning models, enhancing model explainability
  * Modified an existing system to transform machine learning queries into Datalog queries that also
capture provenance and compute explanations


Skills
======
* Techincal: Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit Learn, C++, Matlab, Prolog, Datalog, SQL
* Language: Mandarin Chinese (beginner)
